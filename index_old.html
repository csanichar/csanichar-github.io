        <h1><span>About Me</span></h1>
            <p>I am a recent graduate from the Electrical Engineering program at the University of Waterloo, and very team-oriented and driven to do well in problem solving situations. Over my six internships in technology,
            I have acquired a strong background in information systems, developing software applications and working in team environments. Throughout my four consecutive internships at a
            high-tech company I have developed strong abilities in performing data analysis on test results, developing solutions that meet client standards, broadened leadership mindset,
            and become an excellent collaborative team member. My personal interests include expanding my coding knowledge and learning about new developments in the technology world today.<br><br>
                <strong>Career Goals</strong><br><br>
             I am looking to use my technical background to join a successful technology driven company, as a Software Developer.
                My long term goals include getting into a Technical Project Manager role to help identify root causes, employ strategies for technical risks, and helping to prioritize issues that arise.</p>

                <h2>Product Developed:</h2>
                <p>Working in a group with four other classmates, we implemented a method to scan an object  using a CMUT device and produce a 3D visualized volume with a high Signal-To-Noise ratio using MATLAB.</p>
                <h3>Stage 1:</h3>
                <p>In Stage 1 shown to the right we collected raw data using a CMUT to produce multiple 2D images of size 560x360 pixels using MATLAB. </p>
                <h3>Stage 2:</h3>
                <p>In Stage 2 we researched and applied image processing techniques to remove noise and sharpen the image quality. The approach we found most beneficial was a method called bilateral filtering.</p>
                <h3>Stage 3:</h3>
                <p>In stage 3, the 2D images that we were able to create were then mapped to the real world coordinate system. Following this we used a linear interpolation technique to to map points from the 2D images to a 3D volume.
                    And in order to differentiate the surroundings from the object, we applied an opacity filter to achieve this.</p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center">Mobile Application for Vehicle Maintenance <strong>(Current Project)</strong></h1>
                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>Currently I am working with a Start-up company called Ansik, to help develop a mobile application for both android and IOS that will be able to read engine codes through a vehicle's engine ECU using an on-board diagnostics device that directly plugs into a car below its dashboard and communicates through bluetooth.
                    The languages being utilized to develop this application is html, css, javascript, and angularJS.</p>
                <h2>Purpose?</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this product is to be able to utilize these engine codes to observe how a vehicle's functions are performing, including monitoring the battery, breaks, or antifreeze fluid to name a
                    few. This information will help alert owners of any malfunctions occuring within the car, who can take this information to mechanics to get repair quotes and also give them a better understanding of what kinds of problems are occuring with the vehicle.</p>
